<p>The <a href="https://chronospedia.com">Chronospedia</a> project is a supposedly horological know-how preservation project that makes many promises, but has a rhetoric full of approximations and contradictions. It presents itself in particular as innovative and revolutionary for horological 3D, as well as open. It has rallied a number of museums that do not seem to be versed in 3D or in research. In reality, the Chronospedia project is neither revolutionary, nor open, nor even at the forefront of technology, as shown in the table below. But above all, I believe that this project is dangerous for horological heritage, because it does not take into account the priorities of horological conservation and is not involved in horological research (neither technical nor historical). A <a href="https://horloges.github.io/chronospedia-en.html">detailed study</a>
of the problems of this project has been given elsewhere.

<p>In the table below, I examine the achievements of Chronospedia
in relation to the needs of the researchers of which I am a part, on the one hand,
and to the priorities of heritage conservation on the other hand.
3D is far from being a priority for the conservation of horological
heritage and the real priorities should be inventory and
documentation. By focusing on 3D, entire sections of horological
heritage risk being even more neglected and may disappear.

<p>Notes of February 4, 2025:

<ul>
<li>As for the project's publications, the project leaders
(F. Simon-Fustier and K. Protassov) have not published
ANY technical or historical articles on clockmaking or particular clocks as of
the beginning of 2025. Their only publications are a few
announcements relating to the Chronospedia project and its structuring,
  as well as "press releases" in the AFAHA bulletin.
  Furthermore, Pierre Judet, member of the steering committee,
  defended a thesis in 2000 on the subject
  "Horlogeries et horlogers du Faucigny (1849-1934)", but it can obviously not
 be included in the project, otherwise we would have to
include all the horological literature in the Chronospedia
publications.
<li>Almost all of the points presented here could be validated. The 3D models could be put online, it is possible
to present a glTF file with access to the metadata
(<a href="https://horloges.github.io/3D/notredame.html">I did it at the end of January 2025</a>),
restoration reports could be put online
(at least those of Mr. Simon-Fustier), photographic files too
(for example, there are 500 photographs in the file of the restoration
  of the Cluses clock), etc.
<li>According to a <a href="https://hal.science/hal-04484358v2/file/La%25203D%2520au%2520secours%2520du%2520patrimoine%2520horloger.%2520CHRONOSPEDIA.pdf">presentation of Chronospédia from 2023</a>, the project
  was considering using Google's <a href="https://modelviewer.dev/">modelviewer</a>, or Smithsonian's <a href="https://smithsonian.github.io/dpo-voyager/">Voyager</a> viewers,
  but the truth is that none of these viewers are necessary,
  and they are also not adapted to clockworks.
Chronospédia can and must develop its own viewer, exactly like I did.
<li>So, let's wait and see!
</ul>

  <p>Notes of February 5, 2025:

    <ul>
      <li>The Chronospédia site features a few models accessible
	in Augmented Reality (AR) through GLB files.
	However, one should note that there isn't anything extraordinary
        here, because GLB files can be produced from glTF files, or at the same
        time as glTF files, and they can be put online with a few lines
        of code. I have done it myself <a href="https://horloges.github.io/3D/notredame_ar.html">here</a>. (In order to work, your phone needs to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARCore">ARCore</a> compatible.)

      <li>In the end, it appears that the Chronospédia project contains
       almost no own know-how. This project is putting forward
       technologies that anyone can easily manipulate without Chronospédia.
    </ul>

  <p>Notes of February 7, 2025:

    <ul>
      <li>I have put online a model of the Notre-Dame clock in glTF
	with at the same time selectable parts, metadata and motion,
	something that Chronospédia has still not yet been able to do.
    </ul>
